What is admin.html?

admin.html is a standalone helper page (you can save it on your computer or host it).

It contains form inputs (title, price, images, sizes, etc.).

You fill in details â†’ click Generate â†’ it creates ready-made product HTML.

You then copy-paste that HTML into a Blogger post editor (in HTML mode).

ðŸ‘‰ Example Workflow:

Open admin.html in your browser.

Fill product details (title, price, discount, images, sizes, etc.).

Click Generate Code â†’ get product HTML output.

Click Copy button.

Go to Blogger Posts > New Post > HTML view â†’ paste.

Publish â†’ your product appears styled with your theme CSS.

3. Workflow in Action

Prepare your theme

Add the product-card CSS inside <style> in theme.xml.

Add <script> for thumbnails, quantity buttons, etc.

Create a product using admin.html

Enter details:

4. Suggested Improvements

Here are some more advanced ideas:

âœ… Add Lightbox / Fullscreen Image View

Clicking main image opens it in a popup viewer (like Amazon/Flipkart).

âœ… Global CSS in Theme

Instead of pasting CSS in each post â†’ put your CSS in theme.xml.

Then all products share the same style.

âœ… Reusable Shortcodes

Create custom Blogger shortcodes like <product-card>...</product-card>.

Easier to reuse across posts.

âœ… Cart System (optional, advanced)

Use Google Sheets + Script or a small JS cart system to allow Add to Cart.

Or integrate with PayPal / Stripe links inside Buy Now button.

âœ… Filters / Categories

Add labels (like Men, Women, Shoes, etc.) â†’ Blogger automatically creates filter pages.
